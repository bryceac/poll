==Notes==

This application has been tested on PHP 8.4.3 and <strong>should</strong> on later.

Also, because this application uses SQLite, be sure your server has the PDO drivers for SQLite.

===Installation===

Download the archive or clone the repo to where your server looks for files.

As long as the location has PHP enabled, 
the PDO SQLite module is enabled, 
and the DirectoryIndex is set for both <strong>index.html</strong> and
<strong>index.php</strong>, things should operate just fine.
