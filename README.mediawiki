==Notes==

This application has been tested on PHP 8.4.3 and <strong>should</strong> on later.

Also, because this application uses SQLite, be sure your server has the PDO drivers for SQLite.

===Installation===

Download the archive or clone the repo to where your server looks for files.

As long as the location has PHP enabled, 
the PDO SQLite module is enabled, permissions are properly set,
and the DirectoryIndex is set for both <strong>index.html</strong> and
<strong>index.php</strong>, things should operate just fine.

===Questions===

<ol>
<li>
<dl>
<dt style="font-weight:bold">Why create this when there are already plenty of other options?</dt>
<dd>
<p>While there are many different polling options, especially for streaming, such as 
<a href="https://www.livereacting.com/poll-in-live-stream">LiveReacting</a>, 
many of them cost money or were more suited to engagement on websites than what I needed.</p>
<p>Plus, I thought it would be nice to challenge myself 
at creating a polling system for that can just be linked up 
to bots that are already part of streams, such as Nightbot.</p>

<dt style="font-weight:bold">How do I add this to my stream?</dt>
<dd>
<p>This would depend on how you are broadcast the stream, 
but after adding a new command 
to the bot you use for your stream that calls the URL to cast a vote,
make sure to add the main URL for the poll as a browser source, 
so viewers can see it.</p>

===Creating Polls===

To create a poll, you would visit an address like this:

<pre>
http://example.com/poll/create
</pre>

This will display a form, 
where you can fill in the question or prompt and options.

Each option will for the poll is to them be listed on its own line.

===Voting===

For users to be able to cast their votes, they would typically enter a URL, 
with query string like this:

<pre>
http://example.com/poll/vote?choice=hello
</pre>

The system works like this, 
so that it has an easy pattern to associate with bots like Nightbot,
as the intention was to use this while live streaming.

As such, it is strongly recommended to use a browser source to display 
the poll, so that users can see what their options are.

However, as I have yet to do testing with bots, 
I do not know they will handle the given format.
